Compare the estimated training and inference energy consumption of ResNet-50, BERT-base, and GPT-2 on standard datasets (e.g., ImageNet for ResNet, GLUE for BERT, WebText for GPT-2). Then, estimate the CO2 emissions associated with each, assuming training on an Azure Standard_NC6s_v3 VM for 24 hours. Provide tables for clarity, and recommend the most energy-efficient model per task type (image classification, text classification, and text generation).",
